          Call for papers (2022 International Workshop on Emerging ICT)
        </p>
        <p>
          The annual conference, Korea-Japan-China International Workshop will
          be held in Yeungnam University, Korea in October 27-28, 2022. This
          conference aims at improving the mutual understanding of educational
          and research activities of the three universities (Yeungnam
          University, Tohoku University, and Dalian University of Technology).
          Since the first conference held at Yeungnam University in 2004, the
          three universities have hosted this annual ceremony every year, taking
          turns although since 2017, Dalian University of Technology has
          replaced UESTC of China. Undergraduate and graduate students are
          encouraged to participate in this academic meeting as well as the
          faculty members. It will be a great opportunity for sharing their
          university lives and recent research results in the area of
          electronics and communications.
